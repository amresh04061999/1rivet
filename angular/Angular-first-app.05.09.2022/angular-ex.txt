1 angular 13 and 14 features

  Angular 14 :
  1)Angular CLI Auto-Completion
   CLI enables real-time type ahead auto-completion in the terminal.

  2) Strictly Typed Forms
   Strictly typed forms are Angular's most requested feature request on GitHub,
    and they will improve Angular's model-driven approach to working with forms.

  3)Angular DevTools
  In offline mode, you can use the Angular DevTools debugging plugin.

  4)Enhanced Template Diagnostics
  The latest version of Angular 14 comes with better template diagnostics, allowing Angular developers to be
  protected from common errors by the compiler, similar to how TypeScript code is protected.
